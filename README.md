# Mako-server
The server that comes with mako in the "examples" folder is weak and doesn't work, so this is my attempt to fix it.

## Installation

It can be run from wherever it was downloaded. The default config file is config.conf. A sample.conf is provided

## Command line options

-h/--help: prints help
--suppress-urge-to-kill: will not kill other mako web server processes
-c/--config-file: specifies an alternative configuration file
-P/--pidfile: specifies an alternative process identifier file
